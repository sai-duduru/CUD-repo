1. Once the tofu is ready reduce the heat and the milk mix that you set aside to the skillet and let it simmer for 3-5 mins, while stirring occasionally. Break apart the tofu into sizeable chunks of your choice or break it all the way down. Pieces should look like granola crumble.
1. At this point go ahead and taste your creation and add any spices, salt or pepper to match your taste. **But be careful it will be hot. DO NOT BURN YOUR TOUNGE!!**
1. Heat up the tortilla in your pan until its hot/ or crispy if that’s the way you prefer

***Remember you can also add seasoning at the end of the cooking phase, so you do not need to oversalt while cooking.***

***For better consistency you can always seer the tofu before adding it to the skillet.***

***Be careful not to burn yourself while adding ingredients or tasting.***

***If it is too liquidly then go-ahead and close the lid and let it simmer longer. Or if you want you can add vegan cheese.***

***If it is dry or not enough liquid, then go head and add milk to it. But remember that the finished product should be dry and should crumble in your hand.***
